# Gisaïa

Gisaïa develops ARLAS, an open source platform for exploring geo-analytically huge volumes of spatio-temporal data.

To begin with ARLAS Exploration, you can start the full software stack on your computer with the [ARLAS Exploration stack project](https://github.com/gisaia/ARLAS-Exploration-stack). Also, three tutorials are available for loading data in ARLAS. You can try a tutorial with [bird tracking data](https://github.com/gisaia/ARLAS-stack-birdstracking-tutorial), another one with [vessel tracking data](https://github.com/gisaia/ARLAS-stack-ais-tutorial) (also called AIS data) and finally a last one with [polluant data](https://github.com/gisaia/ARLAS-stack-openAQ-tutorial).
